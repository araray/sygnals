    Applies a chorus audio effect [Placeholder].

    Chorus creates a thicker sound by mixing the original signal with copies
    that are slightly delayed and pitch-modulated using a Low-Frequency Oscillator (LFO).

    NOTE: This is a placeholder implementation and returns the input signal unchanged.
          A real implementation requires modulated delay lines.

    Args:
        y: Input audio time series (1D float64).
        sr: Sampling rate of `y`.
        rate: Rate of the LFO modulating the delay time (Hz, default: 1.5).
        depth: Depth of the delay time modulation (seconds, default: 0.002).
               Determines the intensity of the pitch modulation effect.
        delay: Average delay time offset (seconds, default: 0.025).
        feedback: Feedback gain for the delayed signal (0 to < 1, default: 0.2).
        wet_level: Gain level for the chorused (wet) signal (0 to 1, default: 0.5).
        dry_level: Gain level for the original (dry) signal (0 to 1, default: 1.0).

    Returns:
        The processed audio time series (currently identical to input).

    Raises:
        ValueError: If input `y` is not 1D.

    # --- Placeholder Implementation ---
    # A real implementation would involve:
    # 1. Creating an LFO signal (e.g., sine wave) at the specified rate.
    # 2. Using the LFO to modulate the delay time around the base delay value, scaled by depth.
    # 3. Implementing a variable delay line that can read samples at non-integer delay times (requires interpolation).
    # 4. Mixing the dry signal with the output of the modulated delay line(s), potentially with feedback.

    # Return input signal unchanged for now
