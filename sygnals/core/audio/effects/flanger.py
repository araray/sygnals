    Applies a flanger audio effect [Placeholder].

    Flanging is similar to chorus but uses shorter delay times and often more
    feedback, creating characteristic sweeping comb filter effects.

    NOTE: This is a placeholder implementation and returns the input signal unchanged.
          A real implementation requires modulated delay lines with feedback.

    Args:
        y: Input audio time series (1D float64).
        sr: Sampling rate of `y`.
        rate: Rate of the LFO modulating the delay time (Hz, default: 0.5).
        depth: Depth of the delay time modulation (seconds, default: 0.005).
        delay: Average delay time offset (seconds, default: 0.001). Must be very short.
        feedback: Feedback gain for the delayed signal (0 to < 1, default: 0.5).
                  Can be positive or negative for different sounds.
        wet_level: Gain level for the flanged (wet) signal (0 to 1, default: 0.5).
        dry_level: Gain level for the original (dry) signal (0 to 1, default: 0.5).

    Returns:
        The processed audio time series (currently identical to input).

    Raises:
        ValueError: If input `y` is not 1D.

    # --- Placeholder Implementation ---
